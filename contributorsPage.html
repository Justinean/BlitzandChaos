          <h2>Concept</h2>
          <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
          <p>An interactive story where the main character - YOU, the user - will embark on a mission to save the world from a DRAGON! I mean, it’s a dragon, so how will this happen? Right? The user will read a story and make decisions, which will determine the final outcome. In the end, you will either find a way to save everyone (including yourself) or be forced to watch everything burn in an unstoppable, fiery apocalypse. The choice is yours. Choose wisely, my friend. </p>

          <h3>User Story</h3>
          <p>GIVEN THE TEXT-BASED STORY, I want to be able to make choices and interact with a fictional storyline. I want to change the story’s outcome by “traveling” (using different pages as different locations) and choosing between different paths. My choices will have consequences, altering the storyline and changing the ending. At the end, based on my saved choices, I will either win (by defeating the dragon) or lose. </p>

          <h3>Motivation for development</h3>
          <p>We wanted to let users experience being the protagonist in a story (in a type of text-based game), allowing them to have agency over the direction the story takes and letting them experience how their individual choices affect the outcome of a fictional world.</p>

          <h2>The Process</h2>
            <h3>TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
              <p><b>Styling:</b> We used <a href="https://bulma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bulma</a> as a CSS styling framework.</p>
              <p><b>API's:</b> We utilized the <a href="https://freesound.org/docs/api/authentication.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Freesound.org</a> API for background music, and the <a href="https://www.pexels.com/api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pexels</a> and <a href="https://api.artic.edu/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Art Institute of Chicago</a> API's for background images.</p>
              <p><b>Other Technologies:</b> Some <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jQuery</a> was also used in this project.</p>
            <h3>BREAKING DOWN THE TASKS</h3>
              <p><b>Functionality:</b> Much of the functionality of the application (the JavaScript and jQuery) was written by Megan Steblay and Justin Hoch.</p>
              <p><b>Styling:</b> Much of the layout and styling of the application (CSS, HTML, and use of Bulma) was written by Heather Bjoin and Mike Steinmetz.</p>
              <p><b>Story:</b> The story text itself was written by Heather Bjoin with assistance from Megan Steblay.</p>
            <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
              <p>In any project, there are of course challenges. We had to work out how to utilize API's that we had never encountered before, and we had to figure out how to implement Bulma and make our application responsive. There were also ideas that we had to work out that seemed really complicated using just JavaScript or jQuery... how do we make a story that isn't quite linear, that shifts around itself and cascades down, like a type of graph? We also had to work on communication: with four of us building the same project, we had to try to figure out a system of listening, contributing, and distributing tasks.</p>

          <h2>Future Advancements</h2>
          <p>There are many ways that this project could be expanded on. Initially, we had dreamed big about a game that was more open-world. The story would be less linear so that the player could move around to different locations as they desired, even returning to locations they had already visited. In future developments, more functionality could be added. Perhaps our player would have stats, perhaps the game would keep track of time and days would pass as you played. Perhaps the player would have an inventory where they could collect items along the way and use them in parts of the story. The story could change depending on which locations you visited in what order. There could be multiple stories that could be unlocked and played.</p>
          <p>We had only two weeks to build this project, and ended up with a compact, interactive game — but we see many possibilities for the further advancement of Blitz and Chaos.</p>
