      <div id="conceptContainer">
        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
        <p>An interactive story where the main character - YOU, the user - will embark on a mission to save the world
          from a DRAGON! I mean, it’s a dragon, so how will this happen? Right? The user will read a story and make
          decisions, which will determine the final outcome. In the end, you will either find a way to save everyone
          (including yourself) or be forced to watch everything burn in an unstoppable, fiery apocalypse. The choice is
          yours. Choose wisely, my friend. </p>

        <h3>User Story</h3>
        <p>GIVEN THE TEXT-BASED STORY, I want to be able to make choices and interact with a fictional storyline. I want
          to change the story’s outcome by “traveling” (using different pages as different locations) and choosing
          between different paths. My choices will have consequences, altering the storyline and changing the ending. At
          the end, based on my saved choices, I will either win (by defeating the dragon) or lose. </p>

        <h3>Motivation for development</h3>
        <p>We wanted to let users experience being the protagonist in a story (in a type of text-based game), allowing
          them to have agency over the direction the story takes and letting them experience how their individual
          choices affect the outcome of a fictional world.</p>

      <div id=processContainer>
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <h3>TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Bulma</li>
          <li>Pexels</li>
          <li>Art Institute of Chicago</li>
          <li>Freesound</li>
          <li>jQuery</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Styling:</b> We used <a href="https://bulma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bulma</a> as a
          CSS styling framework.</p>
        <p><b>APIs:</b> We utilized the <a href="https://freesound.org/docs/api/authentication.html" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Freesound.org</a> API for background music, and the <a
            href="https://www.pexels.com/api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pexels</a> and <a
            href="https://api.artic.edu/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Art Institute of Chicago</a>
          APIs for background images.</p>
        <p><b>Other Technologies:</b> Some <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">jQuery</a> was also used in this project.</p>
        <h3>BREAKING DOWN THE TASKS</h3>
        <p><b>Functionality:</b> Much of the functionality of the application (the JavaScript and jQuery) was written by
          Megan Steblay and Justin Hoch.</p>
        <p><b>Styling:</b> Much of the layout and styling of the application (CSS, HTML, and use of Bulma) was written
          by Heather Bjoin and Mike Steinmetz.</p>
        <p><b>Story:</b> The story text itself was written by Heather Bjoin with assistance from Megan Steblay.</p>
        <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
        <p>In any project, there are of course challenges. We had to work out how to utilize APIs that we had never
          encountered before, and we had to figure out how to implement Bulma and make our application responsive. There
          were also ideas that we had to work out that were complicated using just JavaScript or jQuery... how
          do we make a story that isn't quite linear, that shifts around itself and cascades down, splitting and then
          rejoining, like a type of graph?
          We also had to work on communication: with four of us building the same project, we had to try to figure out a
          system of listening, contributing, and distributing tasks.</p>
        <h3>SUCCESSES</h3>
        <p>We knew we were attempting something somewhat complicated for the four of us to complete in the span of two weeks. 
          However, we experienced many successes with our project. We figured out not only how to write a cascading storyline
          in JavaScript, but also how to refactor it: making it more consolidated and efficient. We successfully utilized
          multiple APIs whose use greatly improves the immersiveness of our project. And, we wrote an entire choose-your-own-adventure 
          script unique to our project!</p>

      <div id="storyContainer">
        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p> The idea for the story came from deciding we wanted to do something interactive. We had big ideas, and had to compact them. So here we are, with a story about one person sent out on quest to save the world from a dragon named Fraener. The decisions the reader makes can have a massive impact on the final outcome. The only thing is, they won't know until the end. Every choice has a consequence, some good, some not so much, and others will automatically lead to devastating outcomes.</p>

        <h2>Future Advancements</h2>
        <p>There are many ways that this project could be expanded on. Initially, we had dreamed big about a game that
          was more open-world. The story would be less linear so that the player could move around to different
          locations as they desired, even returning to locations they had already visited. In future developments, more
          functionality could be added. Perhaps our player would have stats, perhaps the game would keep track of time
          and days would pass as you played. Perhaps the player would have an inventory where they could collect items
          along the way and use them in parts of the story. The story could change depending on which locations you
          visited in what order. There could be multiple stories that could be unlocked and played.</p>
        <p>We had only two weeks to build this project, and ended up with a compact, interactive game — but we see many
          possibilities for the further advancement of Blitz and Chaos.</p>
